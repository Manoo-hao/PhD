    "In addition to the original script, 2_generate_TP, this script does a blast search of selected_tp_genes against temp_neg_genomes and filters out all genomes that have a hit. In addition to 2.1_generate_TP, this script also does an hmm search, using an alignment of selected_tp_genes as query against negative genomes. It combines results of blast and hmm searches and removes all samples with hits from the pool of neg_genomes to choose from. One further parameter is required to specify an hmm evalue cutoff for samples to remove. Ideally, this would be 0, but I decided to keep a cutoff, as the original negative genomes from the sugimoto paper also have positive hits for an oxyN hmm.\n",

    "- pos_isolation_source_filter, if these terms are found in the isolation_source column of the positive samples in the summary file, they will be scored higher in a scoring column, i.e. samples from a known and desired isolation source will be used preferentially.\n",
    "- neg_isolation_source_filter, accordingly\n",
    "- avoid_list. These terms are scored with a 0, end at the bottom of the table, and will be picked last. This is useful when an uncommon gene is searched for and more, and/or more tenuous isolation sources have been allowed during download.
