    "This script downloads gbk and fasta files fo generating the synthetic metagenome inputs for metaBGC build. It is far from perfect, but it's a start. Currently, the genomes parsed and downloaded are randomised. This is in principle horribly inefficient and depending on the search term, this script can run for a couple of days. However, it can be justified with generating a relatively unbiased dataset (at least as unbiased as the random number generation is).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways of specifying the downloads through the following inputs:\n",
    "- BGC_type: Name of the output directory relative to the current working directory. This name must stay constant throughout the remaining scripts.\n",
    "- amount_pos_genomes: The amount of positive genomes for the specified search_term\n",
    "- amount_neg_genomes: The amount of negative genomes for the specified search_term\n",
    "- search_term: name of the protein of interest to parse in the feature tables. Has to be all lower case. Can be the full term to be specific, or just part of a name to have a more loose search. E.g. 'nitrile hydratase subunit alpha' vs. 'nitrile hydratase'.\n",
    "- neg_isolation_source_filter and pos_isolation_source_filter: pass a list of terms to narrow down the isolation source of organisms. These can be individually specified and don't need to be the same. To permit all isolation sources, pass ['', 'isolation_source not annotated']\n",

    "- summary.csv: table with accession number, isolation source, organism, description, as well as for positive hits protein_id and amino acid sequence of all downloaded genomes\n",
    "- backup_pos_accessions.txt: a list of refseq accession numbers that refer to genomes positive for search_term, but not downloaded as they were not in the desired pos_isolation_source_filter.\n",
